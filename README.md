## Overview and Origin

* Webank, established by Tencent, Baiyeyuanin and Liye Group in December,2014, is now viewed as the leading Chinese fintech and the leader in digital bank globally. 

* With the aim of getting credit to SMEs, WeBank have providesd loans to more than half million SMEs in China since 2017 and reported revenue of USD1.5 billion and profit of USD 400 Million in 2018.

* The valuation of webank have increased incredibly in the past five years. In the late 2018, the webank’s valuation passed $21 billion, making it one of the world’s largest unicorns.

## Business Activities:

* Getting credit or loan to SMEs is a long-acknowledged problem within Chinese banking system. Part of the root of the problem is banking nature ---- being afraid of losing money. 

* In China, there are about 30 Million SMEs and only 2% of them can have loans or credit from traditional banks. However, Webank, which is focused on solving the problem, have served more than half million SMEs in the past two years. 

* Webank actually does a great job in providing loans to SMEs in China while keeping its NPL(Non-performing Loan) ratio low(Webank 1% VS Industry average 1.8%). 

* The reason for Webank success are: Fintech. By applying artificial interlligence, Big Data, cloud computing and blockchain into its system, Webank know their SMEs client better than any other traditional bank in China, though webank don't have any physical branches. For example, Webank designed a AI platform which consist of the data from different industries and companies. According to the white book, the platform can help the contributor have more client data without violating the privacy law in China.

* One of the Webank's biggest advantage is the support from wechat, which is the most popular SMS app in China and has served more than 1 billion user in the world. Wechat can bring a hugh number of personal client to the Webank.


## Landscape:

* Webank is the leading participant in digital banking in China. The two biggest innvoation in this field in the past 5-10 years are P2P and epayment. Webank, as a digital banking, is the combination of the two. The main competitors for Webank in China are Aibank backed by Baidu Group and Ant financials backed by Alibaba Group. Besides, some traditional banks,such as ICBC and CMB, also invested a lot in the transformation and they are also strong competitors for Webank because of their large volume.


## Results

* So far, webank have made a big success in digital banking and loan market for SMEs. 
At the end of 2018, Webank own a Rmb154.5 billion ($21.5 billion) deposit base, up 2800% on 2017. The bank also reported a Rmb10 billion revenue and a Rmb2.5 billion net profit, a far cry from its first year when it lost Rmb538.8 million in 2015. Compared with ICBC, Webank is nothing based on the asset, revenue or profit. But webank's NPL actutally is much lower than the average level of banking industry.


## Recommendations

* From my perspective, Webank, as a digital bank, can help chinese centarl bank to provide and distribute official chinese crytocurrency to its users.

* By using blockchain and cloud computing, people outside china also can use it as an exchange media, which should have the following advantages: trustable and transferable.
